## Chinese Text MultiClassification

Description:
	This project was created for text classification,as we all know, text classication played an importent role in nlp tasks,so it was worth studying with different
algorithms,and in this repo we will supply different methods to complete classification,include deep learning and traditional algorithms like svm, naive bayes.
The main features of this project that we develop a completed framework of classification from data pre-processing,feature selection, model training and predict,
and model update strategy,so that it can be easily migrated and used.

### 1. Machine Learning parts
#### 1.1 document classification
#### 1.2 feature selection & extraction



### 2. Deep Learning parts
#### 2.1 word embedding
#### 2.2 document classification with DL


### TBD
