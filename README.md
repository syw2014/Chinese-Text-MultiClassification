## Deep Learning & Machine Learning

Description:
	This is the record of learning DL , which may contains study papers, dl frameworks, and dl algorithms implementation.But firstly , it will be 
	start with tensorflow.It also will contian the traditional machine learning algorithm tasks like classification, regression, feature engineering etc.

### 1. Machine Learning parts
#### 1.1 document classification
#### 1.2 feature selection & extraction



### 2. Deep Learning parts
#### 2.1 word embedding
#### 2.2 document classification with DL


### TBD
